Nodemon - a way to restart the server when changes have been made
 which nodemon - make sure you see nothing, if you get a folder path you already have it 
 - npm install nodemon -g 
 -go to package.json and add in the scripts "watch":"nodemon ./bin/www"
 -you can then run on the terminal npm run-script watch and it will reload the server after you save changes
 
 
 In your app.js file
 //This below allows you to chain all events on a url in one time rather than each have a seperate route
 // the character '*' will allow anything after chicken as long as the url begins with chicken
  app.route('chicken')
    .get(genericCallback)
    .post(PostCallback)
    .put(PutCallback)
    .delete(DeleteCallback);

//This function is called if the url in browser is localhost:3000/    
function genericCallback(req, res){
    res.json({key:value});
}
    
//This function is called if the url is a post request which can't be seen in the url (use postman extension in chrome to see)
function postCallback(req, res){
    res.json({key2:value2});
}

//The ':' character plus whatever in this case 'id' creates a paramater on the req
app.get('/ducks/:id', stoppingCallback);

//This would send back whatever you typed after localhost:3000/ducks/(whatever you type) 
function stoppingCallback(req, res){
  res.send(req.params.id);
}
