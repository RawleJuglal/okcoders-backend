Express Code is server code that handles client requests


curl --v(verbose) url (www.google.com)
It will connect to the ip address (74.125.193.147)
GET / - this will tell the server get me the root file

HTTP/ 1.1. 200 OK - 200 ok is the status code that says we were able to get the information requested.
